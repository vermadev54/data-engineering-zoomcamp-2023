# Problem Description
A digital platform known as a crypto dashboard resides on a website or an app (either desktop or mobile). Its main job is to keep track of your cryptocurrency coins, keep track of their historical prices, and keep an eye on their current values so you can manage your crypto assets and associated financial plans accordingly. To update your crypto assets in real-time, the dashboard integrates with cryptocurrency exchanges or trackers like CoinCap API via an API or other tool.



# Dataset





# Technologies Used

For this project I decided to use the following tools:
- **Infrastructure as code (IaC):** Terraform
- **Workflow orchestration:** Airflow
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **Data Lake:** Google Cloud Storage (GCS)
- **Data Warehouse:** BigQuery
- **Transformations:** SQL (Pyspark will be used in the future with more time and one less technical error!) 
- **Visualization:** Google Data Studio
